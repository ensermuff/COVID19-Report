# COVID19-Report
COVID19 Report for any US state county

The project involves creating a program that provides COVID-19 reports for any US state county specified. 
A user is to be prompted to enter any county of interest, in which the program will provide a report relevant 
to the county (e.g. total new cases in 2021, average new cases in 2022, cumulative cases as of 12/31/22, etc.). 
Output information of the report is detailed below.

This project involves real reported COVID-19 data from John Hopkins University's github, 
so the output values should make logical sense.

This project involves using pandas and geopands and their dependency libraries.
